# Reuse Facilitation Corridors

Mapping where reuse initiatives and youth-centered spaces intersect across New York City.
## Overview
This project begins with curiosity about where learning, care, and participation already take place across New York City. By mapping youth-centered spaces such as schools, libraries, and after-school programs alongside reuse + repair organizations, it explores how everyday community anchors might support environmental education, collaboration, and shared making. Rather than proposing fixed solutions, the project looks for patterns, gaps, and points of proximity that suggest where facilitation, partnerships, and collective reuse practices could grow.
## Methods
After-school programs are used as a proxy for youth participation at a neighborhood scale. Proximity is explored to suggest everyday access rather than formal service boundaries. Conceptual corridors are derived from areas of spatial overlap, highlighting where informal partnerships or shared programming might emerge.
## Data & Scope
This analysis does not capture all forms of reuse activity. Organizations without fixed locations, such as repair cafés, pop-up workshops, or informal community spaces, are not fully represented. These gaps point to opportunities for future expansion of this living map.

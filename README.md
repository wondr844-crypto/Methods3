This project asks where everyday practices of repair, reuse, and shared making might grow into neighborhood-scale environmental education.

##Overview
Understanding where environmental practice takes place within communities requires examining both access and visibility. This project maps circular economy organizations alongside schools, libraries, and after-school programs to establish a spatial frameworks. In order to examine how environmental learning opportunities are distributed across Brooklyn. By placing these sites in relation to one another, the project examines where overlaps already exist and where proximity may support future collaboration. The maps are designed to surface questions of connection, co-location, and the conditions under which partnerships might emerge.

##Programs & Organizations
Circular economy organizations operate across New York City and represent multiple entry points into environmental practice, including textile reuse, tool sharing, and green workforce development. These organizations vary in structure: some operate from fixed locations, while others function as pop-ups or mobile programs. Not all are represented just yet; this map is intended as a living document. This will continue to expand as additional organizations, potential routes, and partnership possibilities are identified.

Physical proximity provides an initial way to understand how programs and organizations relate to one another across space. The maps show that circular economy organizations are distributed unevenly across Brooklyn, with clusters appearing in North Brooklyn. As one travels further down, fewer sites are located if any in parts of Central, South, and East Brooklyn along with after-school programs in school. These spatial relationships point to areas where youth programming and circular economy activity do not currently overlap. Raising questions about how public institution such as libraries and other shared civic spaces, might function as sites for collaborative, hands-on environmental learning.
